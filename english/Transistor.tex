\tyt{The Spine}
\auth{sł. muz. Darren Korb}

It's just skin and bones\\
Nothing inside\\
Sleeping alone\\
Fingers tied themselves\\
In knots around the heart\\
It beats in time
\hops
I see the spine of the world\\
Sparkle and shine, light the inside\\
I see the spine of the world\\
I know it's mine\\
Twisted and tied
\hops
You always go\\
Walking on coals\\
Walk away slow\\
Feel the fire\\
Light your way to me\\
My siren song for you
\hops
I see the spine of the world\\
Sparkle and shine, light the inside\\
I see the spine of the world\\
I know it's mine\\
Twisted and tied\\
I see the spine
\hops
So come with me\\
We'll fly right over, right over\\
Watch it break\\
If we get closer, much closer\\
\hops
I see the spine of the world\\
Sparkle and shine, light the inside\\
I see the spine of the world\\
You know it's mine\\
Twisted and tied

I hear you buzzing, a fly on the wall \tab{}\tab{a G F E}\\
In through the window and up through the hall \tab{a G F E}\\
Flying in circles, just trying to land\tab{}\tab{a E F G}\\
I see you hurting, I do what I can \tab{}\tab{a E F G}
\hops
But I won't save you\tab{}\tab{a F E G}\\
I won't save you \tab{}\tab{a F E G}
\hops
Maybe you're looking for someone to blame\\
Fighting for air while you circle the drain\\
Never be sorry for your little time\\
It's not when you get there, it's always the climb
\hops
But I won't save you\\
I won't save you
\hops
I won't save you\\
I won't save you

\tyt{We All Become}
\auth{sł. muz. Darren Korb}

When you speak I hear silence\\
Every word a defiance\\
I can hear, oh I can hear
\hops
Think I'll go where it suits me\\
Moving out to the Country\\
With everyone, oh everyone\\
Before we all become one
\hops
You tell yourself that you're lucky\\
But lying down never struck me\\
As something fun, oh any fun
\hops
Stabbing pain for the feeling\\
Now your wound's never healing\\
Til' you're numb, oh it's begun\\
Before we all become one, oh
\hops
Oh we all, we all become one\\
Oh we all, we all become one\\
Oh we all, we all become one\\
Oh we all, we all become one\\
\hops
Stop grieving, start leaving\\
Before we all become one...\\
Run!\\
Oh, we all, we all become...

\tyt{Signals}
\auth{sł. muz. Darren Korb}

Step out beyond the edge and start the motion\\
Look out below, I know there's no decision\\
Just collision\\
It's all arranged
\hops
Too late for me, no reason to recover\\
If I should choose to rise, I'm still descending\\
Never ending\\
I fall, I fall
\hops
And we all are sending smoke signals\\
Keep pretending we are one
\hops
Take up the call and follow everybody\\
I won't become a number in the system\
Zeroes and ones\\
Not me, not me
\hops
And we all are sending smoke signals\\
Keep pretending we are one
\hops
We're all descending, no strings\\
We keep pretending we are one
\hops
Step out beyond the edge and start the motion

\tyt{Paper boats}

Seconds march into the past \tab{}\tab{d $F^V$}\\
The moments pass \tab{}\tab{C}\\
And just like that they're gone \tab{A}\\
The river always finds the sea \tab{}\tab{d $F^V$}\\
So helplessly, like you find me \tab{}\tab{C A}
\hops
We are paper boats floating on a stream \tab{d $F^V$}\\
And it would seem \tab{}\tab{C}\\
We'll never be apart \tab{}\tab{A}
\hops
I will always find you\tab{}\tab{B A F}\\
Like it's written in the stars \tab{}\tab{F}\\
You can run, but you can't hide\tab{B E a}\\
Try \tab{}\tab{}\tab{A}
\hops
Like the moon that makes the tides\\
That silent guide\\
Is calling from inside\\
And pull me here and push me there\\
It's everywhere, hanging in the air
\hops
We are magnets pulling from different poles\\
With no control\\
We'll never be apart
\hops
I will always find you\\
Like it's written in the stars\\
You can run, but you can't hide\\
Try
\hops
\sng{x2}\\
I will always, always find you \tab{}\tab{D $D7~ D9$}\\
I will always \tab{}\tab{}\tab{D $D7~ D9$}\\

\sng{x2}\\
I will always find you\\
Like it's written in the stars\\
We can run, but we can't hide\\

I will always, always find you\\
I will always
