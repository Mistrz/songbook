Scientist, come sit with me; \tab{}\tab{F G e a}\\
put down your books \tab{}\tab{F G}\\
while I pour you a drink. \tab{}\tab{e a}\\
Like minds have gathered here,\tab{}\tab{F G e a}\\
as the green fairy \tab{}\tab{F G}\\
is getting ready to sing. \tab{}\tab{e a}\\
\hop
\hspace{0.9cm}We'll look out the window \tab{F}\\
\hspace{0.9cm}and gaze at the stars;\\
\hspace{0.9cm}we'll go through the questions\tab{E}\\
\hspace{0.9cm}that no one dares to ask.\\
\hspace{0.9cm}We'll untangle dreams\tab{}\tab{F}\\
\hspace{0.9cm}and go through the facts;\\
\hspace{0.9cm}we'll sketch a world\tab{}\tab{E}\\
\hspace{0.9cm}worth giving a damn.

Scientist, will we ever solve\\
all the riddles\\
of this beautiful world?\\
Is there a pair of eyes watching from above,\\
or are we the children\\
of a cosmic burst?\\
\hop
\hspace{0.9cm}We don't have the answers,\\
\hspace{0.9cm}we might never know\\
\hspace{0.9cm}who's spinning the Earth\\
\hspace{0.9cm}and igniting the Sun.\\
\hspace{0.9cm}What brought us here,\\
\hspace{0.9cm}where do we belong?\\
\hspace{0.9cm}I'm drowning in the night sky,\\
\hspace{0.9cm}I'm feeling so small.\\
\hop
\hspace{0.9cm}Help me make sense \\
\hspace{0.9cm}of this terrible mess:\\
\hspace{0.9cm}why must we endure\\
\hspace{0.9cm}so much pain and distress?\\
\hspace{0.9cm}Do we need to endlessly\\
\hspace{0.9cm}stumble through the night\\
\hspace{0.9cm}to learn how to\\
\hspace{0.9cm}appreciate the light?\\
