Tell her to make me a cambric shirt\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)\\
Parsely, sage, rosemary and thyme\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)\\
Without no seams nor needlework\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(Blankets and bedclothes a child of the mountains)\\
Then she'll be a true love of mine\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
\vskip 3mm
Tell her to find me an acre of land\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)\\
Parsely, sage, rosemary, and thyme\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(Washed is the ground with so many tears)\\
Between the salt water and the sea strand\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)\\
Then she'll be a true love of mine
\vskip 3mm
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)\\
Parsely, sage, rosemary and thyme\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(Generals order their soldiers to kill)\\
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather\\
\hspace{0.9cm}(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)\\
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?\\
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme\\
