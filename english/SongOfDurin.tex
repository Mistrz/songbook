The world was young, the mountains green \tab{a G C F}\\
No stain yet on, the moon was seen \tab{F G e a}\\
No words were laid, on stream or stone \tab{a G e C}\\
When Durin woke, and walked alone \tab{F G e a}\\
\hop
He named the nameless hills and dells \tab{F G}\\
He drank from yet untasted wells \tab{a C F G}\\
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere \tab{F a C G}\\
And saw a crown of stars appear \tab{d C F G}\\
As gems upon a silver thread \tab{}\tab{a G C F}\\
Above the shadows of his head \tab{F G e a}
\hops
The world was fair, the mountains tall, \tab{a G C F}\\
In Elder Days before the fall \tab{}\tab{d G e a}\\
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond \tab{a G d}\\
And Gondolin, who now beyond \tab{C F G}\\
The Western Seas have passed away: \tab{a F G C}\\
the world was fair in Durin's Day. \tab{F G e a}

A king he was on carven throne \tab{a F C G}\\
In many-pillared halls of stone \tab{}\tab{a G F G}\\
With golden roof and silver floor, \tab{a F C a}\\
And runes of power upon the door. \tab{F C F G}\\
The light of sun and star and moon \tab{a F C G}\\
In shining lamps of crystal hewn \tab{d F a G}\\
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night \tab{a G C F}\\
There shone for ever fair and bright. \tab{F G e a}
\hops
There hammer on the anvil smote, \tab{a F C G}\\
There chisel clove, and graver wrote; \tab{a F C G}\\
There forged was blade, and bound was hilt; \tab{a F C a}\\
The delver mined, the mason built. \tab{F C a G}\\
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, \tab{a F C G}\\
And metal wrought like fishes' mail, \tab{d F a G}\\
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, \tab{a G C F}\\
And shining spears were laid in hoard. \tab{d G e a}\\

Unwearied then were Durin's folk; \tab{a C d e}\\
Beneath the mountains music woke: \tab{a G C G}\\
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, \tab{a G C F}\\
And at the gates the trumpets rang. \tab{F G e a}\\
\hop
The world is gray, the mountains old \tab{a G C F}\\
The forge's fire, is ashen cold  \tab{}\tab{F G e a}\\
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls \tab{a G C}\\
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls \tab{F G e a}\\
The shadow lies upon his tomb \tab{a F d e}\\
In Moria, in Khazad-d√ªm \tab{}\tab{a C F G}\\
But still the sunken stars appear  \tab{F a d CG}\\
In dark and windless Mirrormere  \tab{d C F G}\\
There lies his crown in water deep  \tab{a G C d}\\
Till Durin wakes again from sleep \tab{F G e a}\\
