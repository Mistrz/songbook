I'm trying to hold my breath \tab{}\tab{G D e}\\
Let it stay this way \tab{}\tab{C G} \\
Can't let this moment end \tab{}\tab{D}\\
You set off a dream in me \tab{}\tab{G D e}\\
Getting louder now \tab{}\tab{C G}\\
Can you hear it echoing? \tab{}\tab{D}\\
\hops
Take my hand \tab{} \tab{e}\\
Will you share this with me? \tab{C G}\\
'Cause darling without you \tab{D}\\
\hops
All the shine of a thousand spotlights \tab{G}\\
All the stars we steal from the nightsky \tab{D}\\
Will never be enough \tab{}\tab{a e}\\
Never be enough \tab{}\tab{C}\\
Towers of gold are still too little \tab{G}\\
These hands could hold the world but it'll \tab{D}\\
Never be enough \tab{}\tab{a e}\\
Never be enough \tab{}\tab{C}\\
\hops
For me \tab{G}\\
Never, never\\
Never, never \tab{D}\\
Never, for me \tab{e C}\\
For me\\
Never enough \tab{G}\\
Never enough \tab{D}\\
Never enough \tab{e}\\
For me \tab{C}\\
For me\\
For me\\
\hops
All the shine of a thousand spotlights\\
All the stars we steal from the nightsky\\
Will never be enough\\
Never be enough\\
Towers of gold are still too little\\
These hands could hold the world but it'll\\
Never be enough\\
Never be enough\\
\hops
For me\\
Never, never\\
Never, never\\
Never, for me\\
For me

Never enough\\
Never, never\\
Never enough\\
Never, never\\
Never enough\\
For me\\
For me\\
For me\\
For me
