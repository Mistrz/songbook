\tyt{Song of the Lonely Mountain}
\auth{Neil Finn}
\begin{flushleft}
Far over the Misty Mountains rise\\
Leave us standing upon the heights\\
What was before, we see once more\\
Our kingdom a distant light
\hop
Fiery mountain beneath the moon\\
The words unspoken, we'll be there soon\\
For home a song that echoes on\\
And all who find us will know the tune
\hops
\hspace{0.9cm}Some folk we never forget\\
\hspace{0.9cm}Some kind we never forgive\\
\hspace{0.9cm}Haven't seen the back of us yet\\
\hspace{0.9cm}We'll fight as long as we live\\
\hspace{0.9cm}All eyes on the hidden door\\
\hspace{0.9cm}To the Lonely Mountain borne\\
\hspace{0.9cm}We'll ride in the gathering storm\\
\hspace{0.9cm}Until we get our long-forgotten gold
\hops
We lay under the Misty Mountains cold\\
In slumbers deep and dreams of gold\\
We must awake, our lives to make\\
And in the darkness a torch we hold
\hop
From long ago when lanterns burned\\
Till this day our hearts have yearned\\
Her fate unknown, the Arkenstone\\
What was stolen must be returned
\hops
\hspace{0.9cm}Some folk we never forget\\
\hspace{0.9cm}Some kind we never forgive\\
\hspace{0.9cm}Haven't seen the back of us yet\\
\hspace{0.9cm}We'll fight as long as we live\\
\hspace{0.9cm}All eyes on the hidden door\\
\hspace{0.9cm}To the Lonely Mountain borne\\
\hspace{0.9cm}We'll ride in the gathering storm\\
\hspace{0.9cm}Until we get our long-forgotten gold
\hops
We must awake and make the day\\
To find a song for heart and soul
