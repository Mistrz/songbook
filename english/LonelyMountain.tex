\tyt{Song of the Lonely Mountain}
\auth{Neil Finn}

Far over the Misty Mountains rise\\
Leave us standing upon the heights\\
What was before, we see once more\\
Our kingdom a distant light
\hop
Fiery mountain beneath the moon\\
The words unspoken, we'll be there soon\\
For home a song that echoes on\\
And all who find us will know the tune
\hops
\refr Some folk we never forget\\
\refr Some kind we never forgive\\
\refr Haven't seen the back of us yet\\
\refr We'll fight as long as we live\\
\refr All eyes on the hidden door\\
\refr To the Lonely Mountain borne\\
\refr We'll ride in the gathering storm\\
\refr Until we get our long-forgotten gold
\hops
We lay under the Misty Mountains cold\\
In slumbers deep and dreams of gold\\
We must awake, our lives to make\\
And in the darkness a torch we hold
\hop
From long ago when lanterns burned\\
Till this day our hearts have yearned\\
Her fate unknown, the Arkenstone\\
What was stolen must be returned
\hops
\refr Some folk we never forget\\
\refr Some kind we never forgive\\
\refr Haven't seen the back of us yet\\
\refr We'll fight as long as we live\\
\refr All eyes on the hidden door\\
\refr To the Lonely Mountain borne\\
\refr We'll ride in the gathering storm\\
\refr Until we get our long-forgotten gold
\hops
We must awake and make the day\\
To find a song for heart and soul
