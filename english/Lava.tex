\tyt{Lava}
\auth{s≈Ç. i muz. James Ford Murphy}

A long long time ago\\
There was a volcano\\
Living all alone in the middle of the sea\\
He sat high above his bay\\
Watching all the couples play\\
And wishing that he had someone too\\
And from his lava came\\
This song of hope that he sang \\
Out loud every day\\
For years and years

\refr I have a dream\\
\refr I hope it will come true\\
\refr That you're here with me\\
\refr And I am here with you\\
\refr I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above\\
\refr Will send me someone to lava\\

Years of singing all alone\\
Turned his lava into stone\\
Until he was on the brink of extinction\\
But little did he know\\
That living in the sea below\\
Another volcano\\
Was listening to his song\\
Everyday she heard his tune\\
Her lava grew and grew\\
Because she believed his song was meant for her\\
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea\\
As he sang his song of hope for the last time\\

\refr And I am here with you\\
\refr I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above\\
\refr Will send me someone to lava\\

Rising from the sea below\\
Stood a lovely volcano\\
Looking all around\\
But she could not see him\\
He tried to sing to let her know\\
That she was not there alone\\
But with no lava, his song was all gone\\
He filled the sea with his tears\\
Watched his dreams disappear\\
As she remembered what his song meant to her\\

\refr That you're here with me\\

\refr I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above\\
\refr Will send me someone to lava\\

Oh they were so happy\\
To finally meet above the sea\\
All together now their lava grew and grew\\
No longer are they all alone\\
With Aloha as their new home\\
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing\\

\refr I have a dream I hope it will come true\\
\refr That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you\\
\refr We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too\\
\refr I lava you\\
\refr I lava you\\
\refr I lava you
